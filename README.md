# Eyesight for your AI-powered code editor

---

An open source solution to provide AI code editors like Cursor or Github Copilot with actual data from the browser. Just comment on an element and your code editor receives the element with your comment as prompt. No more linking of subfolders and components in your prompts.

Using AI agents to code was a paradigm shift. Everything you can put into words, can now be turned into code. However, often times it takes a lot of iterations or very precise prompts to make sure the agent edits the right files.

That’s where Stagewise comes in. With our toolbar you can send detailed information about the elements and components you want to have changed.  Prompt precision by design.

---

## Features

The Stagewise Toolbar makes it incredibly easy to edit your frontend code with AI agents. Simply select an element from the DOM using the Toolbar and provide a prompt. The Toolbar sends your prompt with additional information about the marked elements to your selected coding agent and requests a fix.

Alongside the DOM element you can provide your agent with further information.

## Getting started

With the release of version 1.0 we only support the Cursor IDE via a VSCode extension. We are working on a Github Copilot integration at the moment.

// Todo: we might need to change that, depending on whether we support the Chrome Extension

You can use Stagewise either with our Chrome Extension or with the SDK. We highly recommend using the Chrome Extension, since the Chrome Extension does include detailed data like screenshots.

### Chrome Extension

Download the latest version of our Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store.

### SDK

### Code editor

**Visual Studio Code and Cursor** 

To use Stagewise with VS Code or Cursor you need our VS Code Extension. This way the Stagewise Toolbar communicates directly with your AI coding agent. 

At the moment we only support the Cursor Agent mode. We are working on a Github Copilot and other integrations.

| **Agent** | **Supported** |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor | ✅ |
| Copilot | ❌ |
| Windsurf | ❌ |
| Cline | ❌ |
| BLACKBOXAI | ❌ |
| Console Ninja | ❌ |
| Continue.dev | ❌ |
| Amazon Q | ❌ |
| Cody | ❌ |
| Qodo | ❌ |

The Stagewise Toolbar automatically connects with the VS Code Extension.

### License

The Goetze, Scharpff & Toews GbR is a commercial open source company, which means some parts of this open source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called “Open Core” where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under AGPLv3 and the 1% is covered under a commercial license which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organizations that plan to implement our technology into proprietary software.

We are deeply committed to the principles of open source and aspire to make our product as open as possible. However, to ensure the long-term sustainability and continued development of the project, we are adopting an **open core** model.

In this model, the core functionalities of our software will remain **open source**, allowing the community to use, modify, and contribute to the project freely. Advanced features, particularly those facilitating integration into proprietary software, will be offered under a **commercial license**.

This approach enables us to: 

- Maintain a robust and secure open source core.
- Ensure the project's financial viability and resource allocation.
- Prevent potential misuse or exploitation that could jeopardize the project's future.

We believe this balance between open source and commercial offerings will foster a healthy ecosystem, encouraging community involvement while supporting the project's growth and stability.
